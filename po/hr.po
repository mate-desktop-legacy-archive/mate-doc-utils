#. "watermark-blockquote-XXXX.png", where XXXX is the Unicode code point
#. of the opening quote character.  For example, some languages use the
#. double angle quotation mark.  Translators for these languages should
#. use "watermark-blockquote-00AB.png".
#. 
#. The image, however, is not automatically created.  Do not translate
#. this to a value if there isn't a corresponding file in mate-doc-utils,
#. under the directory data/watermarks.
#. 
#. Languages that use guillemets (angle quotation marks) should use either
#. 00AB or 00BB, depending on whether the opening quotation is the left
#. guillemet or the right guillemet.  Languages that use inverted comma
#. quotation marks should use 201C, 201D, or 201E.  Single quotation marks
#. don't make very nice watermarks, so if you would normally open a quote
#. with single quotation marks in your language, use the corresponding
#. double quotation mark for the watermark image.
#. 
#. Translators who have been around Mate for a while should recognize
#. this as nearly the same as the "yelp-watermark-blockquote-201C" string
#. once found inside Yelp.  The watermark functionality has been moved to
#. mate-doc-utils.
